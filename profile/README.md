# The End-to-End Lightning (E2EL) Modeling Grand Challenge

E2EL is a community-operated initiative that has developed a [Roadmap](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14624043) for a Lightning Modeling Grand Challenge. The goal is to connect cloud modeling with explicit electrificaion to a model of lightning discharge physics sufficient to produce the full range of electrostatic, optical, and radio frequnecy observables that are now routinely measured.
